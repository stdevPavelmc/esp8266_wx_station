# DIY meteo station

For fun and learn, it uses a ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and a ProMini arduinos linked via I2C, the code for the ProMini is on the [ProMini_wx-station](https://github.com/stdevPavelmc/promini_wx_station)

This is an early stage and design is evolving...

## NOTE

This project is built with Platformio, this is de contents of the src folder in the project, if you use arduino simply change the extension to .ino and remode the include for <Arduino.h> on top of the code.
