# DIY meteo station

For fun and learn, it uses a ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and a ProMini arduinos linked via I2C, the code for the ProMini is on the [ProMini_wx-station](https://github.com/stdevPavelmc/promini_wx_station)

This is an early stage and design is evolving...

## NOTE

This project is a Platformio one, if you use arduino simply copy the files in the `src` folder and change the extensions to .ino and remove the `#include <Arduino.h>` on top of the main.cpp.
